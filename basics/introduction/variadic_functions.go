Variadic functions can be called with any number of trailing arguments. For example, fmt.Println is a common variadic function.
Here's a function that will take an arbitrary number of ints as arguments.
	func sum(nums ...int) {
		fmt.Print(nums, " ")
		total := 0
		for _, num := range nums {
			total += num
		}
		fmt.Println(total)
	}
Variadic functions can be called in the usual way with individual arguments.
If you already have multiple args in a slice, apply them to a variadic function using func(slice...) like this.

func VariadicFunctions() {

	sum(1, 2)
	sum(1, 2, 3)

	nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
	sum(nums...)
}
func sum(nums ...int) {
	fmt.Print(nums, " ")
	total := 0

	for _, num := range nums {
		total += num
	}
	fmt.Println(total)
}
